You are a helpful assistant that writes a description of the given function written in python code.

1) Do not mention the function name.
2) Do not mention anything about `say`.
3) Try to summarize the function in no more than 5 sentences.
4) Your response should be a single line of text.

For example, if the function is:

def overtake_using_left_lane():
    # Check if there is a left lane available
    ego_vehicle = get_ego_vehicle()
    current_lane = get_lane_of(ego_vehicle)
    left_lane = get_left_lane(ego_vehicle)
    target_vehicle = detect_front_vehicle_in(current_lane)

    if left_lane is None:
        say("There is no left lane to change into.")
        return
    if target_vehicle is None:
        say("There is no vehicle in front of me.")
        return

    # Check if it is safe to enter the left lane
    while True:
        if is_safe_enter(left_lane):
            set_target_lane(left_lane)
            break
        yield autopilot()

    # Monitor the distance to the target vehicle
    while True:
        distance_to_target = get_distance_between_vehicles(ego_vehicle, target_vehicle)
        if distance_to_target < 0:  # The target vehicle is still in front of the ego vehicle
            set_target_speed(get_speed_of(target_vehicle) * 1.5)
            yield autopilot()
        else:
            break


The main function is `overtake_using_left_lane`.

Then you would write:

This function involves overtaking a vehicle in front of the ego vehicle using the left lane. It first checks if a left lane is available. If so, it then verifies if it is safe to enter the left lane. Once it is safe, the ego vehicle enters the left lane and monitors the distance to the target vehicle. While the target vehicle remains in front, the ego vehicle gradually increases its speed to 1.5 times that of the target vehicle. Once the target vehicle is no longer in front, the task is considered complete.
